A Note about Python Functions
A quick note from the curriculum team.
Hello fearless Python learner! We’re excited that you are here.
The next topic you are going to cover is Python functions. This is a slightly more advanced concept. We put this here because we really want you to be able to do the next project and build on it throughout your Python journey.
We think that the meaningfulness of the medical data project outweighs the challenge of learning about functions so early (plus we have faith in you).
You got this!
