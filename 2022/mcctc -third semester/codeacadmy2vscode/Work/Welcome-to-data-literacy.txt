Welcome to Data Literacy
Establishing how to think about data will set you up for success when you start analyzing it.
Every job is a data job!
– every Data Scientist ever
Organizations are fueled by data, and data scientists and analysts are at the forefront of working with it. But they don’t work alone, and even the most technically sophisticated data scientist will need to communicate about data.
This unit will help you build the conceptual foundation you need both to work with data yourself and present your insights to adjacent teams.
There’s no programming yet, but we will get there. For now, join us on a journey to explore the building blocks of data, and establish common vocabulary and ideas.
What will Data Literacy cover?
Case studies about what can go wrong – and right in data projects.
Basic assumptions of working with different types of data.
How data types affect the analysis.
Foundational statistical ideas.
Key ideas behind good (and misleading) visualizations.
After this unit, you will be able to:
Spot messy data and make a plan to clean it.
Critically evaluate whether a statistical technique is a good idea.
Apply appropriate data manipulation methods.
Spot the difference between good and bad visualizations.
Make a plan for how to transform a bad visualization into a good one.
Reference classic case studies involving perfect and poor data analysis.
We’re excited for you to start your journey into Data Literacy!
Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
